A Composer package implementing `\Psr\Clock\ClockInterface` that returns the accurate current server time based on its geolocation (determined by IP address).

---

## Purpose

This package provides the server's local time considering its timezone, which is automatically resolved via an external time API based on the serverâ€™s IP address. Useful when server time is set to UTC but localized time is needed.

---

## Installation

```bash
composer require igor-popravka/ip-time-clock
```

## Usage

```php
use IpTimeClock\Clock;
use IpTimeClock\Adapter\WorldTimeApiAdapter;
use GuzzleHttp\Client;

// Initialize HTTP client (Guzzle)
$client = new Client();

// Optionally specify an IP address, or null to use server's IP
$ip = null;

// Create adapter
$adapter = new WorldTimeApiAdapter($client, $ip);

// Create Clock instance
$clock = new Clock($adapter);

// Get current localized time
$currentTime = $clock->now();

echo $currentTime->format('Y-m-d H:i:sP');

```

### Configuration

- By default, the package uses **WorldTimeAPI** to determine the timezone from the server's IP address.

- You can specify a different IP address in the adapter constructor to get the time for a different location.

- To use another time API provider, implement your own adapter by implementing the `TimeApiAdapterInterface`.

### Testing

The package includes unit tests that mock the time API adapter to verify the correct behavior of the `Clock` class.

To run tests:

```bash
vendor/bin/phpunit
```
